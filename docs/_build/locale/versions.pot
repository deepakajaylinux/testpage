msgid "We also create a ``stable`` version, if your project has any tagged releases. ``stable`` will be automatically kept up to date to point at your highest version."

msgid "If you have documentation changes on a **long-lived branch**, you can build those too. This will allow you to see how the new docs will be built in this branch of the code. Generally you won't have more than 1 active branch over a long period of time. The main exception here would be **release branches**, which are branches that are maintained over time for a specific release number."
