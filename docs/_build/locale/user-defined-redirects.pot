msgid "The most useful and requested feature of redirects was when migrating to Read the Docs from an old host. You would have your docs served at a previous URL, but that URL would break once you moved them. Read the Docs includes a language and version slug in your documentation, but not all documentation is hosted this way."

A page at ``/en/latest/install.html`` will be served at ``/en/latest/install/``, or vice versa. The built in redirects for this will handle redirecting users appropriately."
