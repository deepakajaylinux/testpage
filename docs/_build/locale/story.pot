msgid "Read the Docs was `started`_ with a couple main goals in mind. The first goal was to encourage people to write documentation, by removing the barrier of entry to hosting. The other goal was to create a central platform for people to find documentation. Having a shared platform for all documentation allows for innovation at the platform level, allowing work to be done once and benefit everyone."
