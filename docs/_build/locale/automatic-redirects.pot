msgid "This only works for the root url, not for internal pages. It's designed to redirect people from http://pip.readthedocs.org/ to the default version of your documentation, since serving up a 404 here would be a pretty terrible user experience. (If your \"develop\" branch was designated as your default version, then it would redirect to http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/develop.) But, it's not a universal redirecting solution. So, for example, a link to an internal page like http://pip.readthedocs.org/usage.html doesn't redirect to http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html."

msgid "The reasoning behind this is that RTD organizes the URLs for docs so that multiple translations and multiple versions of your docs can be organized logically and consistently for all projects that RTD hosts. For the way that RTD views docs, http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ is the root directory for your default documentation in English, not http://pip.readthedocs.org/. Just like http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/develop/ is the root for your development documentation in English."
