msgid "By default, Read the Docs will use its own custom sphinx theme unless you set one yourself in your ``conf.py`` file. Likewise, setting the theme to ``default`` will accomplish the same behavior. The theme can be found on `github here`_ and is meant to work independently of Read the Docs itself if you want to just use the theme locally."

msgid "This `blog post`_ provides some info about the design, but in short, the theme aims to solve the limitations of Sphinx's default navigation setup, where only a small portion of your docs were accessible in the sidebar. Our theme is also meant to work well on mobile and tablet devices."

That means any changes to the theme or the Read the Docs badge styling should be made there. The code is separate so that it can be used independent of Read the Docs as a regular Sphinx theme."

msgid "Currently the left menu will build based upon any ``toctree(s)`` defined in your ``index.rst`` file. It outputs 2 levels of depth, which should give your visitors a high level of access to your docs. If no toctrees are set in your index.rst file the theme reverts to sphinx's usual local toctree which is based upon the heading set on your current page."

msgid "It's important to note that if you don't follow the same styling for your rST headers across your documents, the toctree will misbuild, and the resulting menu might not show the correct depth when it renders."
