Benefits
----------

* The parameters used in help and installation are not case sensitive which is an added advantage while compared to others.
* It is well-to-do in both Ubuntu and as well as Cent OS.
* This will module installs the php apc in updated version.
* The primary advantage of using Apache OpenOffice as a productivity suite comes from the cost. It includes word processing, spreadsheet, 
  presentation, vector graphic editing and database management components. 
* It's easy for beginners to learn to use, but it is powerful enough to do the advanced tasks experienced users want. It's designed so that
  the  commands and functions you perform in one component of the software work throughout the entire suite.
