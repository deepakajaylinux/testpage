In an encryption scheme, the message or information, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, generating ciphertxt that can only be read if decrypted. It comforts with Ubuntu and CentOS.

		ptconfigure  sshencrypt help


After inputs the above command, it starts functioning to install an encrypted private key. It catechesis the functions in the screenshots.
 The following screen shot shows about sshencrypted

.. code-block:: bash
