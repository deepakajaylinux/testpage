Benefits
--------------

Monitor Amazon EC2: View metrics for CPU utilization, data transfer, and disk usage activity from Amazon EC2 instances (Basic Monitoring) for no additional charge. For an additional charge, CloudWatch provides Detailed Monitoring for EC2 instances with higher resolution and metric aggregation. No additional software needs to be installed.

Monitor Other AWS Resources: Monitor metrics on Amazon DynamoDB tables, Amazon EBS volumes, Amazon RDS DB instances, Amazon Elastic MapReduce job flows, Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon SQS queues, Amazon SNS topics, and more for no additional charge. No additional software needs to be installed. 

Monitor Custom Metrics: Submit Custom Metrics generated by your own applications via a simple API request and have them monitored by Amazon CloudWatch. You can send and store metrics that are important to your applicationâ€™s operational performance to help you troubleshoot and spot 
trends.

Monitor and Store Logs: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor and troubleshoot your systems and applications using your existing system, application, and custom log files. You can send your existing system, application, and custom log files to CloudWatch Logs and monitor these logs in near real-time. This can help you better understand and operate your systems and applications, and you can store your logs using highly durable, low-cost storage for later access.

Set Alarms: Set alarms on any of your metrics to send you notifications or take other automated actions. For example, when a specific Amazon EC2 metric crosses your alarm threshold, you can use Auto Scaling to dynamically add or remove EC2 instances or send you a notification.

View Graphs and Statistics: View graphs and statistics for any of your metrics on the Amazon CloudWatch dashboard, and get a quick overview of all your alarms and monitored AWS resources in one location.
