====================


Synopsis
---------

 Hardy formerly known as GhostStory 2: The Ghostening.  Hardy is a command-line tool that simplifies CSS testing by using Cucumber and makes it simple to include in your automated build process. There's also a chrome extension to simplify making test cases. It runs on Node.JS and uses Selenium. Hardy has been designed to make it as easy as possible to get started with CSS testing, especially integrating it into an existing build process.


Tests are written in Cucumber and use Selenium. Hardy runs on Node.js and therefore all the example CSS test helpers are written in JS. The functionality behind them can easily be reused in any test setup, whether your tests are written in Java, Ruby or anything else.
