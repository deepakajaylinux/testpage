Synopsis
-------------

File is a standard program for recognizing the type of data contained in a computer file. The file command attempts to classify each file system object (i.e., file, directory or link) that is provided to it as an argument (i.e., input). File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it. There are three sets of tests, performed in this order: file system tests, magic number tests, and language tests. 

The first is a file system test, which uses the stat system call to obtain information from the object's inode (which contains information about a file). 

The second test checks to see if there is a magic number, which is a number embedded at or near the beginning of many types of files that indicates the file format (i.e., the type of file).


In the event that the first two tests fail to determine the type of a file, language tests are employed to determine if it is plain text (i.e., composed entirely of human-readable characters), and, if so, what type of plain text, such as HTML (hypertext markup language) or source code
