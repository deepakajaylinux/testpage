Synopsis
-------------

In contemporary business and science a project is defined as a collaborative enterprise, involving research or design, which is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim. Projects can be further defined as temporary rather than permanent social systems or work systems that are constituted by teams within or across organizations to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints. An ongoing project is usually called (or evolves into) a program.

This command is part of default modules and handles project initialization functions, like configuring a project, or a project container and also installing Jenkins build files into a running Jenkins instance.
