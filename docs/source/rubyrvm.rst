RubyRVM
============

Synopsis
------------

Ruby Ruby Version Manager(RVM), often abbreviated as RVM, is a unix-like software platform designed to manage multiple installations of Ruby on the same device. The entire ruby environment including the Ruby interpreter, installed RubyGems, and documentation is partitioned.  These includes JRuby, mruby, MacRuby, IronRuby, Maglev, Rubinius, Topaz. It is user friendly with Ubuntu and cent OS. .

Help command
--------------------

This command can function about the objectives and commands available under Ruby RVM module. It also explains the command to Ruby RVM module. Before installation you read this help command explains its function.

.. code-block:: bash
        
		ptconfigure RubyRVM help

The following image also helps you to understand this module clearly.     


.. code-block:: bash

 kevell@corp:/# ptconfigure RubyRVM help
 ******************************


  This command allows you to install Ruby RVM.

  RubyRVM, rubyrvm, ruby-rvm, rubyRVM

        - install
        Installs Ruby RVM
        example: ptconfigure ruby-rvm install

  Ruby is installed the recommended per-user way. To use ruby after the install
  first run "source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" to get access to the Ruby install for
  your user, then "rvm install 1.9.3" (to install, specify version as needed)
  then "rvm use 1.9.3" (to select your default version for the session)

Benefits
-------------

* RVM is useful even if you don't want to install multiple versions at the same time.
* Getting it from the package manager (at least in ubuntu) gives you an updated version that changes installation directories from the
  default.
* Building from source requires getting a load of dependencies and configuring options. 
* RVM is great as this allows your to install different versions without touching your system's default Ruby install.
* Another great advantage to having RVM are the gemsets - you can create as many gemsets that are unique to the version, and patch level, of 
  ruby.
* Ruby  system is a dynamic, reflective, high-level scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming (OOP).
* In Ruby system, there are many convenient and enjoyable tool. Including the tools that are used in the deployment process.
* The average Ruby system is usually already an experienced professional having extreme knowledge in both web development and general
  software   engineering skills.
* The main advantage of the Ruby programming language and the Ruby System is considered to be the speed of development. 
* Caching projects – one of the most important steps in developing a major Internet project. In PHP, there are various options for data 
  caching.
