GitClone

Synopsis
------------
The ultimate aim of this module is to handle the check out functions. It can perform the check out functions into the project folder of the 
user.

The working nature of this module involves Cloning a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository  and creates, checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s currently active branch.

Let us see about how this module facilitates the users in handling the check out functions, and also about how to use this module from the upcoming topics.


Help Command
-------------------


The help command is a brief user manual. It highlights the primary function of this module, lists outs the alternative parameters that can be used in the declaration, and also explains about the syntax and possible options of using the check out functions under an single option by using help command as shown below,

.. code-block:: bash

		ptdeploy GitClone help


The syntax for declaring the help command is not case sensitive which is an added advantage. The following screenshot visualize you about the help command under git clone.


.. code-block:: bash

 kevell@corp:/# ptdeploy GitClone help

  This command is part of Default Modules and handles Checkout Functions.

  clone, co
