"Apache Cassandra is an open source distributed database management system "
"designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, "
"providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra "
"offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with "
"asynchronous master less replication allowing low latency operations for all"
" clients."

"Cassandra's data model is a partitioned row store with tunable consistency. "
"Rows are organized into tables; the first component of a table's primary key"
" is the partition key; within a partition, rows are clustered by the "
"remaining columns of the key. Other columns may be indexed separately from "
"the primary key."

"Decentralized - Every node in the cluster has the same role. There is no "
"single point of failure. Data is distributed across the cluster (so   each "
"node contains different data), but there is no master as every node can "
"service any request."

"Supports replication and multi data center replication - Replication "
"strategies are configurable. Cassandra is designed as a distributed system, "
"for deployment of large numbers of nodes across multiple data centers. Key "
"features of Cassandraâ€™s distributed architecture are specifically tailored "
"for multiple-data center deployment, for redundancy, for failover and "
"disaster recovery."

"Scalability - Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new "

"Fault-tolerant - Data is automatically replicated to multiple nodes for "

"Tunable consistency - Writes and reads offer a tunable level of consistency,"
