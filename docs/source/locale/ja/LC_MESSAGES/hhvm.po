"This module facilitates installing and un installing the HHVM which is a "
"popular build server to your machine. HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is a "
"process virtual machine based on just-in-time (JIT) compilation, serving as "
"an execution engine for PHP and Hack programming languages. By using the "
"principle of JIT compilation, executed PHP or Hack code is first transformed"
" into intermediate HipHop byte code (HHBC), which is then dynamically "
"translated into the x86-64 machine code, optimized and natively executed. "
"Let us see about the HHVM module in upcoming topics."
