"This article is about the term \"version\" as it is used in various "
"contexts. Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique "
"version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer "
"software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these "
"numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new "
"developments in the software. At a fine-grained level, revision control is "
"often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of "
"electronic information, whether or not this information is computer "
"software."
