"File is a standard program for recognizing the type of data contained in a "
"computer file. The file command attempts to classify each file system object"
" (i.e., file, directory or link) that is provided to it as an argument "
"(i.e., input). File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it. There "
"are three sets of tests, performed in this order: file system tests, magic "
"number tests, and language tests."

#: ../../source/file.rst:10
msgid ""
"The first is a file system test, which uses the stat system call to obtain "
"information from the object's inode (which contains information about a "
"file)."

#: ../../source/file.rst:12

"The second test checks to see if there is a magic number, which is a number "
"embedded at or near the beginning of many types of files that indicates the "
"file format (i.e., the type of file)."

"In the event that the first two tests fail to determine the type of a file, "
"language tests are employed to determine if it is plain text (i.e., composed"
" entirely of human-readable characters), and, if so, what type of plain "
"text, such as HTML (hypertext markup language) or source code"
