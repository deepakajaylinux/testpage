"Copy is the command entered in a Linux shell to copy a file from one place "
"to another, possibly on a different file system. The original file remains "
"unchanged, and the new file may have the same or a different name. Copy is "
"the command which makes a copy of your files or directories. The ways files "
"are copied in Linux depend on your distribution and file system. All "
"versions of Linux could copy files from the command line. There are also a "
"number of file managers both text based and GUI that could be used."

"files now exist in your working directory."
