"Plugins have been released for Jenkins that extend its use to projects "
"written in languages other than Java. Plugins are available for integrating "
"Jenkins with most version control systems and big databases. Many build "
"tools are supported via their respective plugins. Plugins can also change "

"reports in various formats supported by plugins (JUnit support is currently "
"bundled) and Jenkins can display the reports and generate trends and render "
