"Files and directories belong to both an owner and a group. A group usually "
"consists of a collection of users, all belonging to the same group. The "
"first set of three is the read, write, and execute permissions for the owner"
" of the file."

"A group can also consist of one user, normally the user who creates the "
"file. Each user on the system, including the root user, is assigned his or "
"her own group of which he or she is the only member, ensuring access only by"
" that user. The second set of three is the read, write, and execute "
"permissions for anyone who belongs to the user group for the file."

"The root user, the system administrator, owns most of the system files that "

" administration files, like configuration files in the /etc directory, are "
"owned by the root user and belong to the root group. Only the root user has "
"permission to modify them, whereas normal users can read and, in the case of"
" programs, also execute them"
