"Phake is a mocking framework for PHP. It allows for the creation of objects "
"that mimic a real object in a predictable and controlled manner. This allows"
" you to treat external method calls made by your system under test (SUT) as "
"just another form of input to your SUT and output from your SUT. This is "
"done by stubbing methods that supply indirect input into your test and by "
"verifying parameters to methods that receive indirect output from your test."
