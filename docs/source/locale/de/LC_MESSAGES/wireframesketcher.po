"Wireframing is an important step in any screen design process. It primarily "
"allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it "
"easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to "
"process the information. Wireframing is important because it allows the "
"designer to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being "
"distracted by colors, typeface choices or even copy. I like to explain to my"
" clients that if a user cannot figure out where to go on a black and white "
"wireframe, it doesn't matter what colors you eventually use. A button has to"
" be obvious even if it's not shiny or brightly colored."
