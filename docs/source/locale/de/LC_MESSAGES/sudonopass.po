"Sudonopass used to run a particular command with root permissions. The "
"interesting thing is that when the user use sudo for a particular command, "
"system prompts the user for current user’s password. Once the user enter the"
" password, the command runs with root privileges. This is suitable to work "
"with Ubuntu and Cent OS."
