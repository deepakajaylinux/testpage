"Read the Docs stays highly available by serving all documentation pages out "
"of nginx. This means that they never hit our Python layer, meaning that they"
" never hit our database. This reduces the total number of servers to serve a"
" request to 1, each of which is redundant."

"When a user navigates to ``http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/``, we know "

"The ``@fallback`` directive is hit when we don't find the proper file. This "

#: ../../symlinks.rst:52
msgid ""
"CNAMEs add a bit of difficulty, because at the nginx layer we don't know "
"what documentation to serve. When someone requests "
"``http://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/``, we can't look at the URL to know to "
"serve the ``fabric`` docs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../symlinks.rst:57
msgid ""
"This is where symlinks come in. When someone requests "
"``http://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/`` the first time, it hits the Python "
"layer. In that Python layer we record that ``docs.fabfile.org`` points at "
"``fabric``. When we build the ``fabric`` docs, we create a symlink for all "
"domains that have pointed at ``fabric`` before."

"So, when we get a request for ``docs.fabfile.org`` in the future, we will be"
" able to serve it directly from nginx. In this example, $host would be "
"``docs.fabfile.org``:"

"Notice that nowhere in the above path is the project's slug mentioned. It is"
