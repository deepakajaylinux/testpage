"Read the Docs supports multiple versions of your repository. On the initial "
"import, we will create a ``latest`` version. This will point at the default "
"branch for your VCS control: ``master``, ``default``, or ``trunk``."

"We also create a ``stable`` version, if your project has any tagged "

"In the normal case, the ``latest`` version will always point to the most up "
"to date development code. If you develop on a branch that is different than "
"the default for your VCS, you should set the **Default Branch** to that "
"branch."

"You should push a **tag** for each version of your project. These tags "
"should be numbered in a way that is consistent with `semantic versioning "
"<http://semver.org/>`_. This will map to your ``stable`` branch by default."

"If you have documentation changes on a **long-lived branch**, you can build "
"those too. This will allow you to see how the new docs will be built in this"
" branch of the code. Generally you won't have more than 1 active branch over"
" a long period of time. The main exception here would be **release "
"branches**, which are branches that are maintained over time for a specific "
"release number."

"When a user hits the root URL for your documentation, for example "

"version**. This defaults to **latest**, but could also point to your latest "
"released version."
